!   Response:
        Objective: Handle the consequences of a collision.
        Techniques:
!            Impulse Resolution:
                Apply forces or impulses to objects.
                Adjust velocities based on the collision.

                Update positions and velocities according to physical laws.
!            Constraint Solving:
                Resolve interpenetrations and constraints in a physically plausible way.

!   Continuous Collision Detection (CCD):
        Objective: Detect collisions during motion to prevent objects from passing through each other.
        Techniques:
            Predict the motion of objects and check for collisions along the trajectory.
            Time-stepping methods.

!   Sweep and Prune (Dynamic Broad-Phase):
        Objective: Efficiently handle moving objects in broad-phase collision detection.
        Techniques:
            Sort and sweep objects along a specific axis.
            Update the sorted order as objects move.
